# Human-Sight-Patterns-Estimation
Estimation on human sight patterns when looking at a scene.


UNet trained on the "WherePeopleLook" dataset.


## What For
- Interesting to see that the sight on humans when looking at a scene follows a pattern and can be predicted.
- Can be used as a saliency detector, although not usable off-the-selve.
- Maybe can improve image recognition as a general pretrained attention map.

## Results
Some cherry-picked images from a paintings dataset.
